          Living species range from the primitive jawless lampreys and hagfishes through the cartilaginous sharks, skates, and rays to the abundant and diverse bony fishes. <br>
          fish species are cold-blooded:<br>
           however, one species, the opah (Lampris guttatus), is warm-blooded.<br>
            The term fish is applied to a variety of vertebrates of several evolutionary lines.<br>
          It describes a life-form rather than a taxonomic group.<br>
           As members of the phylum Chordata, fish share certain features with other vertebrates.<br>
            These features are gill slits at some point in the life cycle, a notochord, or skeletal supporting rod,
             a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and a tail.<br>
              Living fishes represent some five classes, which are as distinct from one another as are the four classes of familiar air-breathing animals—amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
        liquid food prepared by cooking meat, poultry, fish, legumes, or vegetables with seasonings in water, stock, milk, or some other liquid medium.<br>
          The cooking of soup is as ancient as the devising of vessels to hold liquid; before the development of pots that could withstand the direct heat of a fire, soups were cooked by dropping hot stones into the liquid.<br>
           The long cooking of soup enabled nourishment to be drawn from meagre quantities of fish and meat too bony or tough to be otherwise utilized.<br>

         In the West lighter soups are usually served as a first course, while thicker, heartier soups constitute the entrée for informal meals.<br>
          A notable exception are the fruit soups favoured in northern and eastern Europe, which are often served for dessert. <br>
          In China a thin soup is consumed throughout the meal as a beverage, and elaborate soups such as the celebrated bird’s nest and shark’s fin may be interspersed with other courses or served near the end of the meal.<br>

         
         Many soups are eaten cold.<br>
          French vichyssoise (potatoes and leeks), Spanish gazpacho (tomatoes and other vegetables), Polish chlodnik (beets, sour cream, pickles, and shellfish), Jewish schav (sorrel), and Danish kaernemaelkskoldskaal (buttermilk) are classic cold soups.<br>
           Consommé can be served cold, in which case it takes the form of a jelly as a result of the natural gelatin present in the bony meats from which it is prepared.<br>
